title: 3D Bounding Box Dection using mmWave Radar
summary: mmWave is resillient to adverse weathers such as raining, snowing, and foggy. It is interesting while challenging to generate accurate 3D bbox using the sparse point cloud from mmWave radars.

It is interesting while challenging to generate accurate 3D bbox using the sparse point cloud from mmWave radars. We believe mmWave radar alone cannot complete this job well. We seek to a sensor fusion method.
