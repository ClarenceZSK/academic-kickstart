title: UWB NLOS Identification
summary: It is well known that the ultrawide-band raning in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation is biased due to that the diiferent propagation speed when going through other materials. Identifying the ranging results in NLOS conditions is siginificant in improving the robustness of UWB localization.

Current UWB NLOS identification methods use machine learning techniques to give naive results. The lack of elegent solutions motivates us to open this project.
