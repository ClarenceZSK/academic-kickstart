title: UWB NLOS Identification
summary: Ultrawide-band raning in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation is biased due to the diiferent propagation speed going through walls. Identifying the ranging results in NLOS conditions could improve the robustness of UWB localization.

Current UWB NLOS identification methods use machine learning techniques to give naive results. The lack of elegent solutions motivates us to open this project.
