# abstract: The advances in compact and agile micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) have shown great potential in replacing humans for labor-intensive or dangerous indoor investigation, such as warehouse management and fire rescue. However, the design of a state estimation system that enables autonomous flight in such dim or smoky environments presents a conundrum:.
